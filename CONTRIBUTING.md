# Contributing

1. Make a GitHub issue for your contribution.
	- Please be as specific as possible and supply as much info as you can.
	- Ideally, do this before coding your contribution so people don't duplicate work.
2. `git clone` the repo.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request for your issue.
5. Feel good.
