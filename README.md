# Overview

This repository contains common files that I often need in various GitHub projects. Right now, that's just a [`CONTRIBUTING` file](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines). Eventually, more things that are held in common across multiple projects will be stored here.

# Usage

The best way to use the boilerplate files in this repository is with [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Submodules can be used here since these files are very simple, but they're [not always a good idea](http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/git-submodules-are-probably-not-the-answer/).
